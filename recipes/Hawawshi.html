        <h2>Description</h2>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, add the spices and mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Put the onion, garlic, bell pepper, jalapeno, and parsley in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade, pulse a few times until finely chopped. Transfer the mixture to a sieve to drain excess liquid (it helps to push with the back of a spoon).</li>
                <li>Transfer the onion mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add the ground beef and tomato paste. Mix to combine. Add the spice mixture and a dash of kosher salt. Mix again until the mixture is well combined and the spices are well distributed within the meat mixture.</li>
                <li>Cut the pita loafs in halves to create 12 pita pockets.</li>
                <li>Prepare a large sheet pan brushed with a bit of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
                <li>Stuff each pita pocket with ⅓ cup of the meat mixture. Using the back of a spoon, spread the meat mixture inside the pita pockets.</li>
                <li>Arrange the pitas in the prepared sheet pan. Brush the pita pocket tops with a bit of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the heated oven for 15, then carefully turn the pitas over and cook on the other side another 5 to 10 minutes until the meat is fully cooked and the pita is crispy on both sides.</li>
