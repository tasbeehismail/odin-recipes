                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <h4>Make the crispy onion topping:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sprinkle the onion rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess
                            flour.</li>
                        <li>In a large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings,
                            stirring often, until they turn a nice caramelized brown. Onions must be crispy, but not
                            burned (15-20 minutes).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Make the Tomato Sauce:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon cooking oil. Add the grated onion, cook on medium-high
                            until the onion turns a translucent gold (do not brown). Now add the garlic, coriander, and
                            red pepper flakes, if using, and saute briefly until fragrant (30-45 seconds more).</li>
                        <li>Stir in tomato sauce and pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens
                            (15 minutes or so).</li>
                        <li>Stir in the distilled white vinegar, and turn the heat to low. Cover and keep warm until
                            ready to serve.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Make the Koshary:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan
                            over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17
                            minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt. (Note: when the lentils are ready,
                            they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to
                            them as they need to finish cooking with the rice).</li>
                        <li>Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and
                            the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon cooking oil, salt, pepper,
                            and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice and
                            lentil mixture by about 1 ½ inches (you'll probably use about 3 cups of water here). Bring
                            to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been
                            absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes). Keep
                            covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so.</li>
                        <li>Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to
                            package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a
                            little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dent. Drain.</li>
                        <li>Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Put it All Together!</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To serve, fluff the rice and lentils with a fork and transfer to a serving platter. Top with
                            the elbow pasta and ½ of the tomato sauce, then the chickpeas, and finally ½ of the crispy
                            onions for garnish. Serve, passing the remaining sauce and crispy onions separately.</li>
                    </ol>
