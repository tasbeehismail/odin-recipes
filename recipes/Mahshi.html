            </ul>
            
            <h3>The above mixture is enough for one of the following:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 pounds Mexican squash.</li>

                <li>½ pound grape leaves.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Cooking liquid:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ½ cup hot stock or water.</li>
                <li>1 bouillon cube.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Make the rice mixture:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a pot over medium heat, add oil and then sauté onions until translucent for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato sauce and paste. Stir to dissolve tomato paste.</li>
                <li>When it starts bubbling, add rice, spices and herbs cook for just two minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn heat off and set aside to cool down.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Prepare the veggies:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the veggies thoroughly and clean them well, Note4.</li>
                <li>Core veggies and make sure not to tear the walls especially when making zucchini or eggplants.</li>
                <li>For Anaheim pepper, I usually like to cut it in half for easy stuffing and make sure to buy long straight ones.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Stuff the veggies:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stuff each one with the rice mixture making sure not to reach the top, so basically you want to leave about ½ cm of the top of your vegetable.</li>
                <li>Rice will expand after cooking and if you are overstuffing the veggies, rice will come off. Not that it will taste bad but the presentation will not be as fancy.</li>
                <li>Arrange herbs stems, the inside of your veggies that you just took out, lemon slices, tomato slices or onion slices at the bottom of your cooking pot to prevent scorching.</li>
                <li>Arrange the stuffed veggies in your pot.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Cook:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve bouillon and tomato paste in the hot water.</li>
                <li>Pour into the pot so that the cooking liquid is halfway through the veggies layers.</li>
                <li>Place pot on medium high, bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 40 minutes until veggies are cooked.</li>
                <li>Wait for it to cool down a bit and serve.</li>
            </ol>
